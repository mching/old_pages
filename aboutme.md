title: About me
---

I'm a pediatrician who works with kids who have autism and developmental delays. Like many of my patients, I love computers and making them do things. I mostly completed the Data Science specialization on Coursera and I use some of these skills in work, but still I am just an amateur at this. I hope to use this site as a sort of notebook to document some of my thoughts and keep my already waning programming skills up. Without peer review, I can't vouch for the accuracy of anything I say here, so please don't take anything I write here too seriously!
