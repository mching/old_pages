There's a carnival game at the Iolani Fair called Bank Shot. You have to roll a ball on a ramp into a hole and win a prize. Get it in the green hole and you win tickets, and if you get it in the red hole, you win a big inflatable prize. I wondered what was the rate of hitting the red and green holes.

Here's a picture of the game layout.

## Methods
I gathered data on 48 trials consisting of 2 rolls each. I calcuated the probability of hitting a green hole and hitting a red hole on each roll. I then calculated the probability of hitting a hole if the player had hit a hole on the first roll vs if they had missed on the first roll. I then calculated the overall probability of success for all 2 roll trials.

## Results
### Observed Probability of Outcomes

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(binom)
x <- read.csv("../datasets/bankshot.txt", sep = " ", colClasses = "character", header = F)
x <- tbl_df(x)
x$V2 <- toupper(x$V2)
y <- gather(x, "roll", "outcome", 1:2)
y$roll <- ifelse(y$roll == "V1", 1L, 2L)
```


First I looked at how often the balls fell into the green (G) and red (R) holes or missed a hole entirely (X). This was the frequency of each outcome.

```{r}
table(y$outcome)
```

And this was the percentage of each outcome.
```{r}
round(prop.table(table(y$outcome)), 3)
```

I generated confidence intervals for the three outcomes.

```{r}
binom.estimate <- function(successes, n, method = "exact") {
  library(binom)
  p_estimate <- round(successes/n, 3)
  upper <- round(binom.confint(successes, n, method=method)$upper, 3)
  lower <- round(binom.confint(successes, n, method=method)$lower, 3)
  x <- paste0(p_estimate, " (", lower, "-", upper, ")")
  return(x)
}
```


The probability of getting a green hole was 37/96 or `r binom.estimate(37, 96)`. The probability of getting a red hole was 4/96, `r binom.estimate(4, 96)`. The probability of missing a hole was 55/96 or`r binom.estimate(55, 96)`.

## Conditional Probability Estimates
The next question is whether hitting a hole on the first try changed the probability of getting one on the second try. With this small number of observations, it might be hard to demonstrate this. If I look at the success rate on roll 1 vs. roll 2, it seemed like the rolls were independent. Roll 1 success rate (any hole) was 21/48, `r binom.estimate(21, 48)` vs roll 2 success of 20/48, `r binom.estimate(20, 48)`. 

```{r}
table(roll=y$roll, outcome=y$outcome)
```

However, when I looked at the success rate on roll 2 based on whether the player had a ball hit on roll 1, a different picture developed. 

```{r}
z <- mutate(x, success1 = ifelse(V1 == "X", F, T))
table(z$success1, z$V2)
```

If the player hit on roll 1, they hit on roll 2 as well 6/21 times, `r binom.estimate(6, 21)`. If they did not hit on roll 1, they hit on roll 2 14/27 times, `r binom.estimate(14, 27)`. This seemed to suggest that the hits were not independent. This made sense since the first roll occupies one of the holes, leaving one fewer spot for a success on the second roll. 

Because they weren't independent, I calculated the probability of giving out tickets or a prize for each set of victories. 

```{r}
z <- mutate(x, green = ifelse((V1 == "G" | V2 == "G") & (V1 != "R" | V2 != "R"), T, F),
       red = ifelse(V1 == "R" | V2 == "R", T, F))
table(green = z$green)
table(red = z$red)

```

A player got a green ball 32/48 times, `r binom.estimate(32, 48)`, and a red ball 4/48 times, `r binom.estimate(4, 48)`.

## Discussion
For 2 ball trials, about 2/3 of players hit a green ball and win tickets. About 1/12 of players hit a red hole and win a inflatable prize. To hit our goal of giving away about 12 prizes an hour, we would need to attract 144 games/hour. Even with two game tables, this means more than one game per minute. It's possible but unlikely.

What would happen if we went to 3 balls (as we were doing earlier in the day)? More players would likely get a green and more players would also get a red. Without knowing the conditional probability for the third ball, it's not possible to estimate the rate of tickets or prize giveaways.

If you hit a green on the first ball, is it more likely for you to hit a red on the second ball? I needed more data to establish this, but it would seem possible. The ball might bounce off the ball in a green hole and roll into a red hole more easily. 

## Conclusion
For 2 ball trials on Bank Shot, about 2/3 of players hit a green ball and win tickets. About 1/12 of players hit a red hole and win a inflatable prize.
