Our family has an electric car (Nissan Leaf) and a hybrid (Toyota Prius), and we often have to choose which one we will take out on the weekend. I wondered which one was cheaper to operate and which one was better for the environment.

## Wallet Impact

The Leaf travels about 4.8 miles per kilowatt hour (kwh), and the Prius gets about 55 miles per gallon (mpg). Our electricity costs about $0.35 per kwh, and gas prices have been around $2.50.

Based on these figures, the Leaf costs $0.35 per kwh divided by 4.8 miles per kwh, or $`r round(0.35/4.8, 3)` per mile. The Prius costs about $2.50 per gallon divided by 55 miles per gallon, or $`r round(2.50/55, 3)` per mile. 

The Prius is a lot cheaper with these figures, assuming we get the electricity from the electric company. But what if we have another source for electricity?

We have photovoltaic panels on our house, and they generate most of our electricity need. We spent about $15,000 out of pocket for the system after rebates, and it generates about 10-20 kwh per day. Let's just call it 12 kwh per day on average. The system is rated for 20 years, so I can break the costs down by the up front cost divided by the electricity generated over 20 years. After 20 years with the system, we could be expected to generate 12 * 365 * 20 or `r 12 * 365 * 20` kwh. Ignoring the discount rate, that makes our cost per kwh $`r round(15000 /( 12 * 365 * 20 ), 2)`. At that rate, the cost per mile for the electric car is $`r round(15000 /( 12 * 365 * 20 )/4.8, 3)`. So with our photovoltaic panels, the Leaf is actually cheaper than the $`r round(2.50/55, 3)`/mile for the Prius!

Electricity prices and gas prices have a habit of changing fairly often, so I created a figure to help decide which car to take.

To determine what gas price would have to be to match a given electricity price, we use the equations for cost per mile for gas and cost per mile for electricity, and set them equal to each other.

gas cost per mile = gas cost / mpg

electric cost per mile = electricity cost / miles per kwh

gas cost / mpg = electricity cost / miles per kwh

Solving for gas cost, we get:

gas cost = electricity cost * mpg / miles per kwh

So if electricity costs $0.17 per kwh, then the break-even gas cost would be:

gas cost = 0.17 * 55 / 4.8 = $`r round(0.17 * 55 / 4.8, 2)`.

We can plot this equation.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mpg = 55
miles_per_kwh = 4.8
electricity_cost = seq(0.1, 0.5, by=0.001)
gas_cost = electricity_cost * mpg / miles_per_kwh
qplot(y = gas_cost, x = electricity_cost)
```

For a given electricity price, if the gas price is above the line, then the gas car is more expensive to operate. If the gas price is below the line, the electric car is more expensive.

The one other input is that the price of the two cars is actually quite a bit different. The Prius is about $25,000 while the Leaf is about $35,000. That $10,000 difference, when broken down over 100,000 miles is about $0.10 per mile. That dwarfs the price per mile of the energy input. If we add that extra $0.10 to the Leaf price, well now we have the Leaf costing $`r round(15000 /( 12 * 365 * 20 )/4.8 + 0.1, 3)` per mile and the Prius costing $`r round(2.50/55, 3)` per mile.

In the end, I would conclude the Prius cost to operate is significantly cheaper than the Leaf.

## Environmental Impact
Ok, so the price is probably cheaper for the Prius, but what about the carbon cost? Let's assume I were getting the electricity from the electric company, which uses mostly oil and some coal to make the energy. They have utility (duh) scale generators that don't have to move, so I would assume that they are cleaner than a car's gas engine. 

Coal generates, and oil 1.7 lbs per kwh and coal 2.07 lbs of carbon per kwh. Oahu has 71.1% oil and 19.1% coal

I mean, the Leaf actually doesn't expend any carbon because our photovoltaic panels are generating the electricity, but there are some costs to manufacturing, transporting, and installing the panels.
